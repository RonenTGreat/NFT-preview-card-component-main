## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I liked the fact that I didn't have to be repeating my color schemes. I just used a variable. It's my second time using custom properties in css, thought it's easier in Sass. I plan to keep to this practice more. 


```css
:root{
  --softBlue: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
  --cyan: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
  --mainBG: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
  --cardBG: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
  
}
```


### Continued development

Mobile responsiveness is one of the area I should focus on, I sometimes forget to account for mobile devices. I just see the large and how everything is laid out easily and it escapes me.

## Acknowledgments

[Thu Nghiem](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/thu/). His [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-basics-by-building-a-card-component/) about creating cards was very helpful to me. Learn about that set the ball rolling for me and made the rest very easy.

[Sankara](https://tsbsankara.netlify.app/) and his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/tsbsankara/featured). Through his video I was able to get an understanding of the active state for the image which was giving headaches ðŸ˜‚.
